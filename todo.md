# GitHub Workflow for QEMU WebAssembly Build

## Planning & Setup
[x] Research QEMU WebAssembly build requirements and dependencies
[x] Design workflow structure and trigger events
[x] Determine optimal build configuration for .js and .wasm output

## Workflow Implementation
[x] Create main GitHub Actions workflow file
[x] Set up build environment with Emscripten SDK
[x] Configure QEMU source checkout and build steps
[x] Add WebAssembly compilation flags and optimization
[x] Implement artifact upload for .js and .wasm files

## Testing & Optimization
[x] Add workflow validation steps
[x] Include caching for dependencies and build artifacts
[x] Add error handling and build status reporting
[x] Create documentation for workflow usage

## Additional Features
[x] Add multi-platform build support
[x] Include release automation
[x] Add build matrix for different QEMU configurations
[x] Create README with setup instructions
